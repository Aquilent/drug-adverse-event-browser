@extends('layout')@section('content')  <h2>About this Tool</h2>  <p><strong>How does this tool work?</strong><br />When you enter your search term, this tool searches for your term in a database containing reported occurrences of drug reactions and drug interactions. The top 100 results are returned.</p>  <p>This tool uses data from FDA through its openFDA initiative. OpenFDA provides APIs and is investigating raw download access to a number of high-value structured datasets, including adverse events, drug product labeling, and recall enforcement reports. The platform is currently in public beta.</p>  <p><strong>Where does the data come from?</strong><br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides all data through its OpenFDA initiative. The FDA is responsible for regulating over-the-counter and prescription drugs in the U.S. The FDA collects adverse event reports on drugs, including side effects, use errors, quality problems, and therapeutic failures given to hospital patients or at outpatient centers. A report may contain multiple drugs and patient reactions. No drug is directly connected to an individual reaction. Therefore, no drug is responsible for a specific reaction. To learn more, visit the FDA's <a href="https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/" title="FDA adverse drug event reports since 2004">Adverse drug event reports since 2004</a> report.</p>  <p><strong>What should I do if I see an adverse reaction or drug interaction in my search results?</strong><br />This tool is for informational purposes only. If your search results show a reported adverse reaction or drug interaction, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about your concerns.</p>  <p><strong>My search had zero results. Is the tool broken or are there no possible drug interactions?</strong><br />No, the tool is not broken. First, check the spelling of the drug name you entered and try searching again. Remember that drugs may have multiple names, including generic and brand names. For example, Tylenol is the brand name for the drug acetaminophen, which is also known as paracetamol. Other brand names include Excedrin. Try your search using an alternate name.</p>  <p>Zero results do not mean there are no possible drug interactions. [the data is only so good explanation] If you still receive zero results, talk to your doctor or pharmacist directly about possible reactions or drug interactions.</p>  <p><strong>Can I search for multiple drugs simultaneously?</strong><br />You can search for up to two drugs. The ability to search for more than two drugs is not available currently. We are working to provide this functionality in the future.</p>@stop
