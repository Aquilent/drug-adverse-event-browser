@extends('layout')@section('content')  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>  <p>Our Drug Reaction Finder tool shows how often a reaction was reported to the FDA for a particular drug, as well as reported drug interactions. This tool may not include all possible drug reactions and interactions. The information provided by this tool is for informational purposes only and should not be used as medical advice. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the medicines you take if you have questions or concerns.</p>  <p><strong>About the Data</strong><br />  <p>This tool uses data from FDA through its openFDA initiative. OpenFDA provides APIs and is investigating raw download access to a number of high-value structured datasets, including adverse events, drug product labeling, and recall enforcement reports. The platform is currently in public beta.  <p>OpenFDA is a beta research project and not for clinical use. While we do our best to ensure that the data is accurate, we cannot guarantee the validity of the results.</p>  <p>A report may contain multiple drugs and patient reactions. No drug is directly connected to an individual reaction. Therefore, no drug is responsible for a specific reaction.</p>  <p>To learn more about the openFDA project, visit <a href="https://open.fda.gov/" title="OpenFDA Project"><strong>open.fda.gov</strong></a>.</p>  <p>All trademarks (e.g., drug brand names) remain property of their respective holders and are used only as product data identifiers.</p>@stop
